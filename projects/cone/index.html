      <h5>Background</h5>
      <p>Simulating fluid interaction with solid surfaces requires a description of the geometry. A common method for regular structured grids is to use a signed distance field. Complex shapes can be desribed by stereolithography files but geometric primitives have implicit representations. For example, the distance from any point to the surface of a sphere can be found by subtracting the radius from the distance between the point and the centre of the sphere. The solution for a solid cone is less straightforward as the shape is more complex and the closest point on the surface can be at the apex, on the base or on the side. In a computational mesh we would then like to find the smallest distance between every cell and the surface of a cone described by its apex and the centre and radius of its base.</p>

      <h5>Point Distance to a Cone</h5>

      <p>We want to determine the shortest distance from a point <strong>p</strong> to an arbitrarily oriented cone with apex <strong>A</strong> and a circular base of radius <strong>r</strong> centred at <strong>B</strong>. The point on the cone closest to <strong>p</strong> could lie on its side, base, rim or be <strong>A</strong>. Though we do not know the coordinates of the closest point on the surface, we know that it lies on a plane containing <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> and <strong>p</strong>. We can therefore reduce the problem to 2D and work on a projection of the point and the cone.</p>

          <img class="img u-max-full-width" src="../../images/csc/cone_2.jpg">
          <p align = 'center'>The shortest distance exists on a plane containing A, B and p</p>

      </div> 
      <h5>Projection Plane</h5>
      <p>To define a projection plane, we need to determine a normal and two coordinate axes. Knowing the three points <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> and <strong>p</strong> are on the plane, we can use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product'>cross product</a> to find a perpendicular normalised vector <strong>n</strong>. Defining vectors <strong>pA</strong> and <strong>pB</strong> we can find vector <strong>n</strong> = <strong>pA</strong> &times; <strong>pB</strong>.</p> 
      <pre><code>        //cross product
        n.x = pA.y * pB.z - pB.y * pA.z;
        n.y = pA.z * pB.x - pB.z * pA.x;
        n.z = pA.x * pB.y - pB.x * pA.y;</code></pre> 
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns ">
          <img class="img u-max-full-width" src="../../images/csc/cone_4.jpg">
          <p align = 'center'>j axis</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns ">
          <img class="img u-max-full-width" src="../../images/csc/cone_5.jpg">
          <p align = 'center'>i axis</p>
        </div>         
      </div>  

      <p class='p_pre'>Next we find the axes <strong>i</strong> and <strong>j</strong> of the projection plane. If we take one to be the vector <strong>BA</strong>, the other can be be expressed as the cross product of <strong>BA</strong> and <strong>n</strong>:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns equation">
          <span class="math-box">
            j = BA<br/>
            i = j &times; n
          </span>.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Once we have a definition for a 2D coordinate system, we can project the cone and the point <strong>p</strong> to it. </p>

      <p class='p_pre'>A 3D point <strong>P</strong> with coordinates (x,y,z) can be transformed into its 2D coordinates (v,h) as:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns equation">
          <span class="math-box">
            v = i &sdot; OP<br/>
            h = j &sdot; OP
          </span>,
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>where <strong>i</strong> and <strong>j</strong> are both normalised and <strong>O</strong> is the origin of the projection plane, which we will set to be <strong>B</strong>. We project <strong>A</strong> and <strong>p</strong> and to complete the triangular projection of the cone, we define points at a distance <strong>r</strong> from the projection of <strong>B</strong>.</p>

      </div>

      <h5>Closest Point Transform</h5>

      <p>There are several ways to determine the distance between a point and a triangle. The above projection approach, however, works with any polyhedron with rotational symmetry around an axis and so it is worth looking at a general point-to-polygon distance algorithm. <a href='http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.8.9097&rep=rep1&type=pdf'>The closest point transform algorithm</a> by Sean Mauch can be used to construct an explicit signed distance field of closed orientable polygons in 2D and of tessellated surfaces in 3D. We can use it to find the smallest magnitude distance between our projected point and triangle.</p>

      <p>We can find the smallest distance to a closed orientable polygon by constructing extrusions from its features and testing if our point is whithin any of these regions. If so, we can find the distance to the feature which the extrusion was constructed from and if we record the smallest magnitude value across all extrusions, we end up with the shortest distance to the overall geometry. The smallest distance in the projection plane is equal to the distance to the cone in 3D.</p>
      
      <p>The extrusions are constructed from the vertices and sides of the polygon. We assume that the distances outside the geometry are positive and any point inside has a negative value. A positive side extrusion is generated by projecting the side in its normal direction to some predefined distance. A positive vertex extrusion is a triangle projected along the two side normals meeting at the vertex. The negative extrusions are built similarly but in the reverse normal directions.</p>

        <div class="four columns in-threes">
          <img class="img u-max-full-width" src="../../images/csc/triangle_2.jpg">
          <p align = 'center'>Side extrusions</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four columns in-threes">

          <p align = 'center'>Vertex extrusions</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four columns in-threes">
          <img class="img u-max-full-width" src="../../images/csc/triangle_4.jpg">
          <p align = 'center'>Negative vertex and side extrusions</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>To find the smallest distance between a point and a polygon we need to construct the necessary extrusions, test if the point is inside an extrusion and find the distance to the relevant features. </p>
      <p class='p_pre'> The distance between a point and a vertex is the distance between two points. The distance <strong>d</strong> between point <strong>p</strong> and a side between vertices <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> with a normal <strong>n</strong> can be expressed as:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns equation">
          <span class="math-box">
            d = n &sdot; ap.
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>


      <h5>Half Plane Test</h5>
      <p>To determine if a point is within an extrusion, we can use the half plane test. Any point inside a convex polygon is on the same half plane to all the polygon sides. We can implement this by ordering the vertices of the polygon in a consistent way and then testing if a point is on the same side as all inward pointing side normals. This can be achieved by determining the distance between the point and the oriented sides of the extrusions using the above expression and testing if they all have the same sign.</p>
